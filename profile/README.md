# trivox.io

> Your workflows. Your rules.

**Trivox** is a modular automation ecosystem built for creators, engineers, and studios who live at the intersection of art and code.

This GitHub organization is the home of Trivox's open-source tooling — created not from theory, but from real-world pain points in VFX, game dev, writing, AI content generation, and creative production pipelines.

## 🎯 What is Trivox?

Trivox is not just a single tool — it's a growing **suite of purpose-built tools and frameworks** designed to make creative workflows scalable, automated, and less chaotic.

Whether you're:
- Publishing video edits with versioning,
- Launching Houdini or DaVinci with validated environments,
- Automating storytelling or AI-assisted content creation,
- Or building internal tools for your studio/team...

Trivox aims to support you with reusable, developer-first components.

## 🛠 Philosophy

We don’t build solutions in a vacuum. Every tool in Trivox starts with a real need — usually from the trenches of:

- VFX pipelines  
- Game dev production  
- Creative coding workflows  
- AI-enhanced storytelling  

Our goal is to make modular automation tools that are:
- Easy to extend
- Dev-first, but artist-friendly
- Scalable across small teams and large studios
- Respectful of your privacy, control, and local workflows
