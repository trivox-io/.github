# trivox.io

> Your workflows. Your rules.

**Trivox** is a modular automation ecosystem built for creators, engineers, and studios who live at the intersection of art and code.

This GitHub organization is the home of Trivox's open-source tooling — born not from theory, but from real-world pain points in content generation, creative tech, and modern workflows that blend code, storytelling, and automation.

## 🎯 What is Trivox?

Trivox isn’t a single tool — it’s a growing **suite of purpose-built components** designed to make creative workflows more scalable, automated, and less chaotic.

Whether you're:
- Automating AI-assisted storytelling,
- Publishing media assets with version control,
- Turning brainstorms into structured blueprints,
- Or building internal tools to speed up your creative process...

Trivox is here to support you with reusable, developer-first building blocks.

## 🛠 Philosophy

Every tool in Trivox starts with a real need — usually uncovered through hands-on work in:

- Creative automation  
- AI-powered content creation  
- Story-driven workflows  
- Experimental tooling for creators  

We believe the best tools are:
- **Easy to extend**
- **Dev-first, but creator-friendly**
- **Modular, versioned, and local-friendly**
- **Respectful of your privacy and process**
